There's a new '#data' tag here on my blog, since I've realized a lot of my projects labeled with the '#dev' tag are more specifically data crunching problems, namely the the [Monopoly probabilities](https://chrisfrew.in/interesting-monopoly-probabilities-to-defeat-your-relatives) post and the [Invaders generation](https://chrisfrew.in/data-challenge-rendering-all-32767-invaders) post.

Anyway, this is just a simple housekeeping post - look for more #data tagged posts to come!

Cheers! :beer:
