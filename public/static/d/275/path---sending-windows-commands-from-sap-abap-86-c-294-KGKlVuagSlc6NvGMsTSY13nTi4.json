We were able to verify if the service wasn’t working properly by pinging an RFC node. If the RFC ping returned with an error, then we knew the service was not working - don’t worry, this RFC ping will come into the code later.</p>\n<p>One lazy Friday when I didn’t have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.</p>\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p>I knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line. That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me? With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, Windows has a very nice command for exactly that.</p>\n<p>It’s called <code class=\"language-text\">sc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">C:\\&gt;sc\nDESCRIPTION:\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\n        Service Control Manager and services.\nUSAGE:\n        sc &lt;server&gt; [command] [service name] &lt;option1&gt; &lt;option2&gt;...\n\n\n        The option &lt;server&gt; has the form &quot;\\\\ServerName&quot;\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: &quot;sc [command]&quot;\n        Commands:\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          start-----------Starts a service.\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\n          create----------Creates a service.

We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code class=\"language-text\">sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ”\\\\ServerName”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code class=\"language-text\">ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n…\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start &quot;ServiceName even with Whitespace&quot;</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop &quot;ServiceName even with Whitespace&quot;</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start &quot;ServiceName even with Whitespace&quot;</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code class=\"language-text\">SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"abap\"><pre class=\"language-abap\"><code class=\"language-abap\"><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I’ll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code class=\"language-text\">Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that’s left is to check if the service is not responding. As I summarized above, if the Windows service was broken, the RFC node that talked to it would also be broken. (i.e. pinging it would not work). An RFC node is easy enough to test with function module <code class=\"language-text\">RFC_PING</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"abap\"><pre class=\"language-abap\"><code class=\"language-abap\"><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'RFC_PING'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">DESTINATION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    system_failure        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    communication_failure <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Easy enough. If <code class=\"language-text\">sy-subrc</code> is of value 1 or 2, then it means indeed, that our <code class=\"language-text\">Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION</code> is indeed broken.</p>\n<p>So if it turns out this service is not responding, we call the command pair with function module <code class=\"language-text\">SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>, check <code class=\"language-text\">sy-subrc</code>, and we are done! The total code looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"abap\"><pre class=\"language-abap\"><code class=\"language-abap\"><span class=\"token keyword\">REPORT</span> Z_RESTART_SERVICE<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;---------------------------------------------------------------------*</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Report:  Z_RESTART_SERVICE                                          *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Author: Chris Frewin                                                *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Creation Date: 27.10.2017                                           *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;---------------------------------------------------------------------*</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Requester:                                                          *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Chris Frewin - a report that restarts a windows service             *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;                                                                     *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;                                                                     *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;---------------------------------------------------------------------*</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Changes:                                                            *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Chris Frewin      2017.12.13 - First version                        *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;                                                                     *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;---------------------------------------------------------------------*</span>\n\n<span class=\"token eol-comment comment\">\" Check RFC destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION - if it hangs or returns error, try to restart it</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'RFC_PING'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">DESTINATION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    system_failure        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    communication_failure <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">IF</span> sy<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>subrc <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;></span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">CASE</span> sy<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>subrc<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">WHEN</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">WRITE</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Ping Test RFC Destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION with SY-SUBRC = 1: \"system_failure\" Trying to restart the service...'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">WHEN</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">WRITE</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Ping Test RFC Destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION with SY-SUBRC = 2: \"communication_failure\" Trying to restart the service...'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">WHEN</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">WRITE</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Ping Test RFC Destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION is offline or not functioning properly!

I’m going to be posting a lot more ABAP as well as SAPUI5 content in the coming months. I’ve found that the learning curve for SAPUI5 is a lot higher than other frontend frameworks like React, Vue, or Cycle. I’ve done specialized projects with SAPUI5 is both the EWM and PP modules - There is A LOT of really cool stuff you can do, (especially in EWM) with WebSockets, statistics, and SAPUI5. The bottom line is, I’ve got some great content in the coming months for everyone!</p>\n<p>Cheers everyone! 🍺</p>\n<p><em>Intellectual property/privacy disclaimer: the exact source code and use case have been modified from the real use case at the company I work for, <a href=\"https://www.ospelt.com/en/ospelt/info/home.html\">Ospelt</a>.</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sending Windows Server Commands From SAP ABAP","date":"December 13, 2017","draft":false,"starID":3,"postType":"dev"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/sending-windows-commands-from-sap-abap/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/data-analysis-and-pixel-art-of-towns-and-cities-in-pokemon/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"15 July, 2018","title":"Data Analysis and Pixel Art of Towns and Cities in Pokemon","draft":false,"starID":21,"postType":"dev","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/data-analysis-and-pixel-art-of-towns-and-cities-in-pokemon/","relativeLink":"/data-analysis-and-pixel-art-of-towns-and-cities-in-pokemon/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/some-tasty-bash-profile-commands/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"09 April, 2018","title":"Some Tasty Bash Profile / Bashrc Commands To Make Your Life Better","draft":false,"starID":16,"postType":"dev","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/some-tasty-bash-profile-commands/","relativeLink":"/some-tasty-bash-profile-commands/"}}}}
