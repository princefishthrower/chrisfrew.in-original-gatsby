Such a class could be used in my Twitter bot as well, at least shared across Chrisfrew.in Productions</li>\n<li>Mid to late summer: most paper based business processesed fully automated</li>\n<li>Before New Year 2018: Chrisfrew.in Productions is able to attempt multiple solutions in fixing broken processes, which it also has found by itself. When it exhausts all methods it ‚Äúknows‚Äù to repair itself, THEN it would finally send me an email</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes, if this sounds like science fiction, I was inspired by that totally cool space ship from Passengers that can repair itself:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/passengers-ship-bb6a638030184734ce20de51526ff918.gif\" alt=\"Yeah, that cool ship.\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fully Automating Chrisfrew.in Productions - Part 1 of ??? - Roadmap and Links to Entire Process","date":"May 10, 2018","draft":false,"starID":19,"postType":"dev"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-1-of-roadmap-and-links-to-process/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"24 December, 2017","title":"An NPM Christmas Easter Egg","draft":false,"starID":8,"postType":"dev","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/","relativeLink":"/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-2-of-building-a-node-js-server-monitor/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"11 May, 2018","title":"Fully Automating Chrisfrew.in Productions - Part 2 of ??? - Building a Node.js Server Monitor","draft":false,"starID":20,"postType":"dev","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-2-of-building-a-node-js-server-monitor/","relativeLink":"/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-2-of-building-a-node-js-server-monitor/"}}}}
