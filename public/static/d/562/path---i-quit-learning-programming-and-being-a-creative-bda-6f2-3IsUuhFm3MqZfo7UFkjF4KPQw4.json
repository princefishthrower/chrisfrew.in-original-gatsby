It’s just too much effort. </p>\n<p>What do I get? Self satisfaction? More job opportunities? A daily challenge? Surely <em>those</em> are things that <em>nobody</em> wants to have! Just stress! Just <em>more</em> work piled on top of work!</p>\n<p>I’m just gonna get my snug 40 hour a week job and call it a day. No more self-development, just buy a house, move in, and work that 9-5 for the rest of my days. You win life. I’m out.</p>\n<h1>My Resolve</h1>\n<p>So, I can hear you nearly closing your tab (if you haven’t already) rolling your eyes, and sighing, saying something like <em>this loser - it’s just a blog</em> . However, there <em>is</em> something that affects <em>you</em>. In light of my lifestyle change,</p>\n<p><strong><em>I won’t be making any more Skillshare videos, any more art prints, or programming a single line ever again.</em></strong></p>\n<h1>A Scrap of Good News</h1>\n<p>Sorry if I’ve offended you in this post, but there’s even better news:</p>\n<p>this is an April fool’s post. 😂</p>\n<p>Oh, it’s also my birthday (NOT an April fools joke = trust me I’ve heard that one just a few times 😉). </p>\n<p>I’m 27. And old. 💀</p>\n<p>🍺 Cheers!</p>\n<p>-Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I quit Learning, Writing, and Being a Creative.","date":"April 01, 2019","draft":false,"starID":501,"postType":"life"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-quit-learning-programming-and-being-a-creative/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"24 December, 2017","title":"An NPM Christmas Easter Egg","draft":false,"starID":8,"postType":"dev","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/","relativeLink":"/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/data-analysis-and-pixel-art-of-towns-and-cities-in-pokemon/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"15 July, 2018","title":"Data Analysis and Pixel Art of Towns and Cities in Pokemon","draft":false,"starID":21,"postType":"dev","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/data-analysis-and-pixel-art-of-towns-and-cities-in-pokemon/","relativeLink":"/data-analysis-and-pixel-art-of-towns-and-cities-in-pokemon/"}}}}
